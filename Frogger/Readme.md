# Active-LT - Frogger tutorial

This is a simple tutorial to familiarize yourself with Behavior Trees and the Active-LT library. In this tutorial we are going to procedurally animate a simple "frog", as follows:
- The frog (in our case a simple cube) is jumping forward.
- Upon hitting a wall ahead, the frog has ended her journey and her task is 'complete'.

## Setup

1. Create a Unity Project named 'Frogger'

2. Install Active-LT: open the Unity Package manager and use the [+] symbol to add the package using this URL:
`https://github.com/active-logic/active-lt.git`

3. Rename the sample scene to 'Frogger' and create 2 cubes and a plane, as depicted in the illustration.
